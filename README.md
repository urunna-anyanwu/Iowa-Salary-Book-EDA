# Iowa-Salary-Book-EDA

This is an EDA project done on data from the Iowa State Salary Book. The aim of this project was data cleaning and analysis on various Iowa state workers. In particular, analysis is done on their annual salaries and its relationship with other categorical data.

This is an EDA Analysis which concers the Iowa State Salary Book with data from Fiscal year 2007.

The dataset and analysis completed in this book are helpful for those in need of job search recommendations -> What factors are influential in my potential pay? Because these are state works, the data can also be useful for the Iowa government -> What sectors are workers under/overpaid? Is there legislation that's necessary to standardize pay for state workers?

The dataset houses copious amounts of information, and describes State workers from a diverse array of departments and positions. However, I am most interested in the relation to the Annual Salaries of workers and how it changes across different categorical data.
